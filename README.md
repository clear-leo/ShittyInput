This is a very shitty input managing crate, I made it because
I was tired of writing three or four lines per each input.

The benefits to using this crate:
 - Shorten yo code cuh!!!
 
The downsides to using this crate:
 - Unoptimized code
 - May cause errors
 
 
I don't know how to write docs soooo, use cases:
 - ```shittyinput::int()``` returns an integer of size ```isize```
 - ```shittyinput::string()``` returns a string
 - ```shittyinput::float``` has two cases, one of size ```f32``` and
another of size ```f64```. To use them do ```shittyinput::float::bit32()``` or ```shittyinput::float::bit64()```

Here's the code in [github](https://github.com/clear-leo/ShittyInput)
